# Text-classification


**Project Description:**  
This project focuses on implementing a robust and efficient text classification system using **DistilBERT**, a distilled version of BERT that retains 97% of BERTâ€™s performance while being significantly faster and smaller. The aim is to classify input text data into predefined categories, such as spam detection, sentiment analysis (positive/negative/neutral), or topic classification (e.g., sports, politics, tech).

The workflow includes data preprocessing (tokenization, cleaning), transforming text into embeddings using DistilBERT, and feeding the output to a classification head (typically a fully connected neural network). The model is trained and evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Key Features:**
- Utilizes Hugging Face's `transformers` library for easy integration of pre-trained DistilBERT.
- Fine-tunes the model on a custom or public dataset (e.g., IMDb, AG News, or SMS Spam).
- Implements training, validation, and testing pipelines.
- Supports multi-class and binary classification.
- Provides model evaluation and visualization of results.

**Technologies Used:**
- Python  
- Hugging Face Transformers  
- PyTorch or TensorFlow  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)

**Outcome:**  
A high-performance, scalable text classification model suitable for real-world applications such as content moderation, customer feedback analysis, or automated tagging systems.
